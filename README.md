This task focuses on building a one-time migration process using an Azure Function or Durable Function to move product data from a Cosmos DB container into an Azure SQL database. The function reads all documents from the Cosmos Products container and inserts each record into the SQL Products table by mapping fields like id, name, price, and category. If a document contains a tags array, each tag is flattened and stored as a separate row inside the ProductTags table. The migration handles Cosmos DB throttling by using continuation tokens, batching, and limited parallelism to ensure reliability. After processing, the function generates a migration report that summarizes the total migrated items, number of failures, and total execution time.
